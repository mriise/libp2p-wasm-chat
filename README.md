build with `./build.sh`

then serve with your favorite static file server 

i like to use https://sws.joseluisq.net/

`static ./dist -p 9000`


chat server: 
`cd server && cargo run`

**HIGLY BROKEN** 
this assumes quite a few local dependancies that must be filled for this to work for now

`npm i --global typescript@next`
`cd .. && git clone \<libp2p-rust\>`
